							<h3>HISTORY/INSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND</h3>
							
						</div>
						<h4><b>Credit Unions in Asia </b></h4>
						<p>The savings and credit cooperative was introduced to Asian countries by the British colonial government as solution to the rural credit in India and Sri Lanka more than 100 years ago. Even before they had fully consolidated in Germany, cooperatives began spreading in some countries of Asia. In Thailand, cooperatives were introduced in 1915 and in the Philippines in 1892. </p>
						<p>Credit unions had a turning point in the 1960s when for the first time; the credit union training was conducted in Bangkok, Thailand by Social Economic Life of Asia (SELA). The conference was attended by young enthusiastic leaders across Asia who later on pioneered credit unions in their respective countries.  </p>
						<p>The Training cum seminar was very comprehensive and extensive covering those subjects as social and economic significance of credit unions, credit union philosophy and principles as well as credit union management. </p>
						<p>In collaboration with the Philippine Credit Union League (now Philippine Federation of Credit Cooperatives or PFCCO), CUNA (stands for Credit Union National Association in the USA) International organized the 1st training on Credit Union Development Course in Asia in 1961 in Baguio City, Philippines. The training brought together 25 delegates in 12 countries. As follow up of the training, credit unions principle philosophy and ideas were spread all over Asian countries resulting to establishment of first credit union in the Republic of China (Taiwan) in 1963, Hong Kong in 1964, Japan and Thailand in 1965, Malaysia and Vietnam in 1966, and Indonesia in 1970. Korea had already started the first credit union in 1960. Having established credit unions, the Philippine Credit Union League was established in 1960.  </p>
						<p>The same number of countries attended the second training organized with the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and Kasetsart University in October, 1965. The most attended was the third course conducted at Xavier University in Cagayan De Oro City in the Philippines in April 1969. It drew nearly 100 delegates from 15 countries in Asia including the World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) which was formed on the same year. Delegates realized the importance of having a regional body for credit unions to provide platform for sharing experience and learning among Asian credit unions. The training then concluded in the appointment of a Planning Committee mandated to plan for the establishment of the Asian Confederation of Credit Unions. </p>
						</br>
						<h4><b>Formation of ACCU</b></h4>
						<p>On April 28, 1971, delegates from 9 Asian countries - Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Thailand, and South Vietnam came to Seoul, Korea to fulfill an individual collective dream - to cooperate with neighbors for the good of all. The representatives convened to assist and support the Planning Committee in developing the necessary requisites towards the formation of the confederation - an alliance of actual credit union centers leagues, federations of Asian countries with the mission to assist members to organize, expand, improve and integrate credit unions so they can fulfill their potential as effective instruments for the development of people in Asia. The Asian Confederation of Credit Unions or ACCU for short was officially formed. </p>
						<p>After the 4th Asian Regional Credit Union Training Seminar, the confederation held the Inauguration Meeting at the Cooperative Education Institute in Seoul. The meeting enacted the bylaws and approved the series of meetings of the Planning Committee.  On that momentous day, the national leagues in Asia transferred their membership from WOCCU to ACCU.  </p>
						<p>Having already formed their national leagues, five of the nine Asian countries Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, the Philippines, and Taiwan became the founding members of the confederation. The first year membership dues received was US$ 91 from the five founding members.    </p>
						<p>The Board Meeting of WOCCU held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA on May 19, 1971 approved the membership of ACCU.  The certificate of membership reads: "ACCU is accepted in the worldwide credit union movement and is a participant in all programs and provided by WOCCU Inc. services.”</p>
						<p>The affiliation entitled the members of ACCU to WOCCU services such as training programs, and technical support in feasibility studies, developing institutional growth development plans, and legal assistance that leads to the registration of national leagues and federations with their governments. The following year, Augustine J. R. Kang representing ACCU at WOCCU Board Meeting in Halifax, Canada, put the young ACCU into the world map of credit unions. </p>
						<p>Seconded by WOCCU, the Board of Directors appointed Augustine Kang, Jr. as the first General Manager of ACCU.  From 1971 to 1982, ACCU office had been based in Seoul with the office provided by the National Credit Union Federation of Korea. In 1983, the ACCU office was moved to Thailand and a new General Manager Mr. Somchit Supabanpot was appointed who served until 1994. He was replaced by the current Chief Executive Officer Ranjith Hettiarachchi.</p>
						<p>The Credit Union League of Thailand provided an office space for ACCU from 1983 to 1988. The confederation bought a five storey building in 1989 for its office and had used this building until May 2010. </p>
						</br>
						<h4><b>ACCU Today </b></h4>
						<p>In its role as a regional organization for credit unions, ACCU performs representation, development, liaison and coordination functions on behalf of the Asian credit union movements. It also provides members and potential members’ services in long and short-term technical assistance, training, and information.  Governed by a Board of Directors representing member organizations, ACCU operates through six Divisions: the Planning and Development, Member Services, Promotion, Marketing and Research, Business Development, and Support services.  </p>
						</br>
						<h4><b>Governance </b></h4>
						<p>ACCU operates as a regional representative organization of credit unions and similar cooperative financial institutions in the region of Asia. ACCU is representing 40.2 million individual members from more than 45,000 credit unions in 22 countries in Asia.  </p>
						<p>ACCU is owned by its member organizations. Member categories are:</p>
						<ul>

						</ul>
						<p><b>General Meeting: </b>is composed of the official delegate from member organizations. The regular members have voting right and thus can be elected in the Board.
						</p>
						<p><b>Board of Directors:  </b>the General Meeting elects five (5) Directors from the voting regular members to oversee ACCU business.

						<h5><b>&nbsp;</b></h5>
						<h5><b>1971 to 1980 - Motivational</b></h5>
						<p>From 1971 to 1980, ACCU services were focused on introducing the credit union philosophy and principles to Asian countries. Annually, ACCU organized training to educate promoters of credit unions which led to the spread of credit unions in Asian countries. Except for the five founding members of ACCU (Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, Philippines and Taiwan), other federations that have become members of ACCU were formed during this period such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, Malaysia, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka.    </p>
						<p>The promotion of credit unions and building connections are an ongoing support for economies in transition (either from central economy or conflict) such as Cambodia, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Timor Leste, Pakistan and Vietnam.   </p>
						<h5><b>1981 to 1992 - Leadership Development </b></h5>
						<p>Aimed at building human capital, ACCU offered an intensive leadership course on credit union management and Field Organizers training during 1981 to 1992.  Many of those who were trained are still serving the credit union movement in their countries and internationally to some extent. Besides the ACCU sponsored training programs, cooperation among member organizations blossomed. Members of ACCU demonstrated their enthusiasm to learn from each other and share resources through exposure and internship programs between countries.  </p>
						<h5><b>1993 to 2005 - Professionalization </b></h5>
						<p>The decade is considered as the peak of business solutions development aimed to professionalize the credit union operation.  In 1998, ACCU implemented the project on Institutional Development of Credit Unions in Asia (INDECUA) that raised the level of awareness of leaders on the need to professionalize the credit union operation to meet the challenges of globalization. From this project, ACCU has evolved its role from merely technical assistance provider to business solutions developer.  All the solutions developed have been proven to be valuable to credit unions.  </p>
						<h5><b>2006 to 2014 - Quality Assurance </b></h5>
						<p>ACCU steps up to guarantee the value and differentiation of credit unions in the marketplace by developing systems of quality control. Tools such as ACCESS (stands for A1 Competitive Choice for Excellence in Service and Soundness) Branding, Risk Based Supervision, Stabilization Fund, Web-based Benchmarking Service and Governance Framework assist credit unions to raise its market performance and heighten its sense of mission. </p>
						<h5><b>2014 onwards – Integration of the Credit Union Networks </b></h5>
						<p>From 2014 ACCU takes leadership to integrate the credit union networks in Asia. It would mean the federations demonstrating leadership to ensure the viability, growth and sustainability of the network. The federations provide network support in areas of finance, liquidity management, human resource, lending services, marketing, and supervision.  </p>

	                    <p>A co-operative is a group of people acting together to meet the common needs and aspirations of its members, sharing ownership and making decisions democratically. Co-operatives are not about making big profits for shareholders, but creating value for customers – this is what gives co-operatives a unique character, and influences value and principle Co-operative businesses are owned and run by and for their members, whether they are customers, employees or residents. As well as giving members an equal say and share of the profits, co-operatives act together to build a better world. Co-operatives are a flexible business model. They can be set up in different ways, using different legal structures, depending on what works for the members. The definition of a co-operative business is that they are owned and run by the members - the people who benefit from the co-operative's services. Although they carry out all kinds of business, all co-operative businesses have core things in common.</p>

Rather than rewarding outside investors, a co-operative shares its profits amongst the members.</p>

	          <div class="col-sm-12">
	                <div class="causes-details clearfix">
	                    
	                    
	                    <p>A Credit Union is a co-operative financial institution, that is owned and controlled by its members and operated for the purpose of promoting thrift, providing credit at reasonable rates, and providing other financial services to its members.</p>
	                    <p>In many countries, the financial industry is dominated by commercial or government-controlled banks that help implement monetary policies set by a government agency. Credit Unions are different in that they serve the needs of individuals. Most private sector financial institutions are controlled by investors in making a profit on the services offered to user/customers. In Credit Unions, the user/customer is also the owner. All profits made on services offered belong to the membership. Member ownership contributes to the ability to operate soundly while charging affordable rates and serving people other organizations consider unprofitable.</p>
	                    <p>A Savings and Credit Cooperative (SCC) is a group of people who join together to pool their savings and make loans to each other at reasonable rates of interest that cover all costs and provide for adequate sized reserves. The group also aims to educate its members on the wise use of money so they can improve their lives.</p>
	                    <p>To make the process easier, the group maintains a business structure – a cooperative – which functions as an intermediary between savers and borrowers. The members of the group own and control the organization.</p>
	                   
	                   <div class="sec-title"><h4><b>WHO CAN JOIN?</b></h4></div>
	                    <p>SCCs are organized to serve one or more groups of people who have something in common. Everyone who shares the common bond qualifies to join the SCC. They are part of its field of membership. To become a member, a person must purchase one ownership share. Each SCC should be independent and financially self sustainable with an obligation to put the best interests of its members over any other concerns.</p>
						<div class="sec-title"><h4><b>FINANCIAL MECHANICS</b></h4></div>
	                    <p>A SCC uses its member’s shares and deposits to fund loans. So it pays savers for the use of their money. This payment is both a fair return for that use and an incentive to save more. As the pool of savings grows, more loans can be made, more income can be generated, and more members can be served.</p>
	                    <p>The people who borrow from the pool pay interest for the use of the money. This interest is the SCC’s main source of income. Total income must cover the return paid to savers, the SCC’s operating expenses, and reserves for financial stability. It may also fund education programs and additional financial services. Most SCCs identify the benefits they want to offer, then set about earning the income needed to fund them.</p>
	                    <p>SCCs are frequently considered as “non-profit” organizations. By definition these organizations keep only enough income to cover current operating expenses. For SCCs this strategy would amount to self-destruction. It doesn’t allow for expansion or additional benefits when the membership grows and changes. And it doesn’t allow for the losses that inevitably occur, but which are difficult to predict in advance.</p>
	                    <p>What makes a SCC non-profit is that all surplus funds are returned to the members in one way or another. Most often the “return” is in the form of benefits such as lower loan rates, additional services, larger provisions against loss, or new equipment that permits better service. After a SCC has met its other goals, it may give any remaining surplus back to the members as share dividends.</p>
	                    <p>A SCC is also non-profit in the sense that its purpose is to serve the members, not to make money. It needs money to provide services and benefits. In fact, it must be very careful to operate on a sound financial basis. But money is the means, not the end itself.</p>
	                    <div class="sec-title"><h4><b>SCCS ENCOURAGE SAVINGS</b></h4></div>
	                    <p>The first step in using money effectively is to accumulate savings for expected and unexpected demands. When something comes up, savings may cover the entire amount needed or may help the member secure financing. SCCs encourage members to save regularly, even if the amount they can set aside is small. Time and again it has been proven that even people with very little income are able to save something.</p>
						<p>SCCs use member’s savings to make loans to members who need capital for productive purposes. SCCs pay a fair return to savers for the use of their money. The rate paid should be based on SCC costs and the market savings rates and should not be well in excess of the market rate so as not to attract additional funds for which the SCC has no use.</p>
						<div class="sec-title"><h4><b>SCC LOANS</b></h4></div>
	                    <p>To protect member’s savings, SCC loans must be made on a sound basis, with very high expectations that borrowers will meet their obligations. Because the SCC mission is service, SCCs often make small loans that other organizations would dismiss as unprofitable. The SCC must be satisfied that a borrower will have enough income to make the payments and will use credit analysis to determine the borrower has the ability to repay as described in the loan contract.</p>
	                    <p>The loan interest rates charged at SCCs are generally affordable; they should cover SCC costs and compare to average loan rates available at other similar financial institutions. SCC loan rates increase or decrease according to the market.</p>
	                    <div class="sec-title"><h4><b>EDUCATION SUPPLEMENTS SERVICES</b></h4></div>
	                    <p>With a good understanding of financial matters, members can use their money more effectively. So education is another important part of the SCC tradition. SCCs help members understand why savings is important and how to use credit wisely. Seminars may address these or other special topics including improving wage-earning skills and credit rehabilitation.</p>

	                    <p >Co-operatives are democratic organisations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting their policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary co-operatives, members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and co-operatives at other levels are also organised in a democratic manner.</p>

	                    <p>Members contribute equitably to and democratically control the capital of their co-operative. At least part of that capital is usually the common property of the co-operative.
